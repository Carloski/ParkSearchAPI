# Park Search

This Project was created as part of the Thinkfil Full-Stack bootcamp. It displays a list of National Parks in any given state. The user inputs the state's abbreviation and the amount of parks they would like to be disoplayed and press the "Show me" button. The results will display on the screen. This app uses National Park API and was made using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and JQuery.
